- Background color: Light Gray (#F0F3F4), near the primary in hue but almost fully desaturated, providing a subtle and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Sky Blue (#3498DB), analogous to midnight blue, but slightly brighter and more saturated, used to highlight key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif with a modern and neutral look.
- Use simple, line-based icons from a library like FontAwesome or Feather for a clean and consistent look.
